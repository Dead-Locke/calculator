# Calculator Project
## Third project from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-calculator) curriculum. 

This project is a fully functioning calculator with the capabilities found on all simple calculators. It should be able to receive an input of numbers and basic mathematical operations (+, - , *, /) and evaluate the input accurately. **The calculator should not evaluate more than a single pair of numbers at a time.**   Additionally, the [eval() function should not be used.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/eval#Never_use_eval!)

### Goals/Features: 
- [x] Create an interactive calculator with a display that reflects user input.
- [x] Calculates only one pair of numbers at a time, a restriction within the odin carriculum.
- [x] Shows previous answer while displaying new user input
- [x] Buttons to take in user input for all basic mathematical operations (add, subt, mult, divide)
- [x] Additional buttons and functionality like exponents ( ^ ) negation of input (+/-), clear display (C) and backspace (âŒ«)
- [x] A decimal (.) button so that users can input floating point values.
- [x] Keyboard support so that numbers or operations do not have to be clicked on screen.

## Learning Outcomes
- Learned to importance of planning out the steps and logic of a program before writing even one line of code. 
- Learned to organize a step by step map of actions and how to code around that plan. 
- Learned to implement keyboard support via event listeners.
